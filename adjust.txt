These are the Things thats should be adjusted and corrected

1)On the "Sign-in" and "Sign-up" page

a)The sign-up page should not contain a role option only "employee" option since if users are exposed to this they can misuse it, so to fix this create a secret mechanisem for sign-up and login page for admins separetly and dont show it on the user part

b)And when a new user sign-up it should appear on the admin panal and it should notify the admin

c)If a user alreday exists and tries to sign-up dont allow it and give them a warning message saying that user already exists

after the sign in process...
